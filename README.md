There is hardly a man among us who did not initially balk when faced with
the marking scheme Dr. Diamond has used since approximately three semestors
prior to the dawn of time. Hower, it has a flexibility to be admired.
This web &ldquo;application&rdquo; will help you understand where you
stand in any of his classes.

This project consists of a little bit of that nasty sort of modern web
development so much in vogue right now. Upon checking out the repository,
you can grab dependencies via `bower update`. As all
the functionality exists in JavaScript, you don't need a web server to
run it; just open `index.html` locally in your favourite,
ECMAScript&nbsp;_n_-implementing web browser.

If you'd really rather not have to bother with all that nonsense, I quite
sympathise; I will begin hosting a copy somewhere on the public Internet
sometime soon.
